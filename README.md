# GDP-Analysis-India

The overall goal of this project was to help identify the focus areas which will foster economic development for India's respective states. Since the most common measure of economic development is the GDP, I analyse the GDP of the various states of India and suggest ways to improve it.

The data is sourced from https://data.gov.in/ - an Open Government Data (OGD) platform of India. The data for GDP Analysis of Indian States is divided into two parts:

Data I-A: This dataset contains the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.

Data I-B: This dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry), and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies. There is separate dataset for each of the states.

 

There are two parts to this project. In the first part, I analyzed and compared the GDPs of various Indian states (both total and per capita). The GDP of a state is referred to as the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product). Then, I categorised the states into four categories based on GDP per capita and, for each of these four categories, I analyzed the sectors which contribute most to the GDP (such as agriculture, real estate, manufacturing, etc.).

 

In the second part, I analyzed whether GDP per capita is related to drop out rates in schools and colleges.
